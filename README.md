# Professional README Generator

  ## Description
  I created this project so that I can use node.js to create professional readme file through javascript. This will allow users to generate README.md files quickly and assist with setting the headers, table of contents, license and link associated with the README.md file. In this project, I gained additional experience  with using npm, inquirer, and node.js.

  ## Installation
  npm install professional-readme

  ## Usage
  The user can navigate to the program folder in the terminal or opens the integrated terminal through VS code. Then uses 'node index.js' to start the program. The user will then complete prompts through the inquirer and a complete README.md will be generated from the users data.

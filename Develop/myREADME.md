# My Generated Professional README

  

  ## Description
  I created this project to be able to create a professional readme using node.js. This will allow users to create readme's quickly and ensure all parts are added that are needed for the readme. In this project I improved my knowledge of node.js and inquirer.

  ## Usage
  The user can navigate to the program folder in the terminal or opens the integrated terminal through VS code. Then uses 'node index.js' to start the program. The user will then complete prompts through the inquirer and a complete README.md will be generated from the users data.
